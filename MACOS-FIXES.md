# StudioWorld Cross-Platform Fixes

This document summarizes the changes made to make StudioWorld work properly on macOS systems.

## Issues Fixed

1. **LocalDB Compatibility Issue**
   - Problem: SQL Server LocalDB is not supported on macOS
   - Solution: Added SQLite support as an alternative database provider

2. **Entity Framework Core Namespace Issue**
   - Problem: Incorrect namespace usage in Program.cs
   - Solution: Updated the namespaces and removed unsupported one

3. **Database Creation and Migration**
   - Problem: Database migration failures on macOS
   - Solution: Implemented automatic database creation with seed data and static dates

## Changes Made

1. **Database Provider Support**
   - Added Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite package
   - Updated connection strings to use SQLite
   - Modified Program.cs to use SQLite provider on macOS

2. **Seed Data Fixes**
   - Updated ApplicationDbContext.cs to use static dates for CreatedAt and UpdatedAt
   - This resolved the issue with dynamic dates causing migration problems

3. **Migration Scripts**
   - Enhanced migrate.sh script to work better on macOS
   - Added automatic database initialization on application start

4. **Database Provider Switching**
   - Added a utility script (switch-db-provider.sh) to easily switch between SQLite and SQL Server
   - This allows development on both Windows and macOS/Linux systems

5. **Documentation**
   - Updated README.md with platform-specific instructions
   - Updated OPTIMIZATIONS.md to document cross-platform improvements

## Testing

The application has been tested and confirmed to work on macOS with the SQLite database provider. All functionality works as expected:

- Database creation and seeding
- Health checks
- Repository pattern with database access
- Service layer operations
- Home page rendering with data from the database

## Next Steps

1. Continue implementing the remaining controllers and views
2. Consider adding additional cross-platform optimizations as needed
3. Set up CI/CD to test on both Windows and macOS environments
